# Reporting Security Issues
I take security bugs seriously and appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings. I will acknowledge your contributions.

To report a security issue, please use the GitHub security tab of the repository and create a new report via the button "Report a Vulnerability".

After receiving the report, I will keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement, and may ask for additional information or guidance.

Report security bugs in third-party modules to the person or team maintaining the module.
